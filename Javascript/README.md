EvilShapes
-----------
A game where you just shoot shapes around. At first, I wanted to make it in a full scale game (add mana, lives etc) using only Javascript. Shortly after, though, I've discovered JQuery, and changed my mind. No point in reinventing the wheel.

RockPaperScissors
-----------
The RPS game from codecademy tutorial.
